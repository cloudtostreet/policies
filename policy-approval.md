# Policy Approval

Changes to information security policies should be made through pull requests on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudtostreet/policies). The policies are owned and [IT Risk Management Committee](/risk-assessment.md). Changes to policies must be approved by a member of the committee (other than the author) and merged into the `main` branch before they come into effect.
