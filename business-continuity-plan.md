# Business Continuity Plan

Cloud to Street's business continuity plan (BCP) outlines the general processes used to continue or resume delivery of products and services after a disruptive event.

### Incident response

The [incident response process](/incident-response.md) is one tool for ensuring business continuity.

### Backups

All production data that is required in order to deliver Cloud to Street's products should be backed up to a secondary, reliable data store.

### Outage detection

An incident could be detected internally by monitoring tools, by an employee in their course of work, or reported by a third party including customers.

### Outage response and remediation

If a suspected outage or other business continuity incident is detected, it should be responded to following the [incident response process](/incident-response.md).
