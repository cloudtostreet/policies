# Business Continuity Plan

Cloud to Street's business continuity plan (BCP) outlines the general processes used to continue or resume delivery of products and services after a disruptive event.

### Incident response

The [incident response process](/incident-response.md) is one tool for ensuring business continuity.

### Backups

All production data that is required in order to deliver Cloud to Street's products should be backed up to a secondary, reliable data store.

### Outage detection

An incident could be detected internally by monitoring tools, by an employee in their course of work, or reported by a third party including customers.

### Outage response and remediation

If a suspected outage or other business continuity incident is detected, it should be responded to following the [incident response process](/incident-response.md).

### Continuity testing

Cloud to Street conducts continuity testing exercises twice per year. These exercises simulate business interruptions due to internal systems issues, critical third-party outages, and absence of key personnel. Cloud to Street does not induce any actual business interruption as part of the simulations.

Cloud to Street keeps notes on these exercises. The notes can be provided to auditors upon request.

The [IT Risk Management Committee](/risk-assessment.md) coordinates continuity testing exercises.
