# Incident Response

Cloud to Street's customers are dependent on our services operating as normal. Our incident detection and response practices support the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our services.

### Incident detection

An incident may be detected by any employee in their course of work. Incidents may also be reported by end users and other third parties.

All Cloud to Street employees should report suspected incidents affecting confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our services. Incidents can be reported to the Slack channel [#eng-crossteam](https://cloudtostreet.slack.com/archives/C019BM0G9K6).

Cloud to Street reviews and responds to potential third-party reports of security issues to [support@cloudtostreet.info](mailto:support@cloudtostreet.info) promptly.

### On-call rotations

Cloud to Street should use on-call rotations to ensure that someone is available to respond to urgent system issues.
