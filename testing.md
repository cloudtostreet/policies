# Testing

To avoid potential security incidents, Cloud to Street requires testing of its software to ensure that it functions as expected.

Changes to production cod should be tested by Cloud to Street's continuous integration (CI) system prior to being merged. Changes to production code should also pass through the code review process, being reviewed by at least one other employee.

In exceptional cases, changes to production code may be merged without passing continuous integration and code review (a "hotfix"), such as to resolve an incident.
