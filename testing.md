# Testing

To avoid security incidents, Cloud to Street requires testing of its software to ensure that it functions as expected.

Changes to production code should be tested by Cloud to Street's continuous integration (CI) system prior to being merged. Changes to production code should also be reviewed by at least one other employee as part of the code review process.

In exceptional cases, changes to production code may be merged without passing continuous integration and code review (a "hotfix"), such as to resolve an incident.
