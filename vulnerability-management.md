# Vulnerability Management

Cloud to Street employs a variety of technical and procedural safeguards for addressing vulnerabilities in our software and information systems.

These approaches vary from system to system, as each system generally requires a different kind and degree of defense. Some broad approaches we use include:

**Automated integration tests:** All first-party software used in production should have a set of tests. The tests should be run automatically on every code change as part of the [software development lifecycle](/software-development-life-cycle.md).

**Automated deployment pipelines:** To reduce downtime and the opportunity for human error, Cloud to Street systems should have automated deployment processes.

**Application scans:** For sensitive code, such as code that accepts untrusted user input, Cloud to Street should scan the application code to mitigate errors and abuse.

**Secure application frameworks:** Sensitive code should be abstracted into small, well-tested, hard-to-misuse primitives.

**Dependency scans:** Cloud to Street employs automated vulnerability scanning on dependencies included in our source code repositories.

**Container scans:** Cloud to Street employs automated vulnerability scanning on container images that are used in production.

**Infrastructure scans:** Cloud to Street scans cloud infrastructure for overpermissioning and opportunities to reduce our attack surface.
