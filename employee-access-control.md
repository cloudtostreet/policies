# Employee Access Control

Cloud to Street limits employee access control based on job requirements, following the principle of least privilege.

### Access to internal systems

Where possible, access policies should be enforced by technical measures.

Cloud to Street systems must have sufficient granularity to allow appropriate authorized access. There is a delicate balance between protecting the systems and permitting access to those who need to use the systems for authorized purposes. Cloud to Street recognizes that balance.

### End user devices

Employees are responsible for safe handling and storage of Cloud to Street-provided end user devices. If a device is lost or stolen, the loss must be immediately reported as an incident.

### Changing roles or responsibilities

Terminated employees must have their accounts disabled within 1 business day of termination. Where possible, the account data should be retained. The full procedure for revoking access is documented in the Offboarding Checklist document available on Google Drive.
